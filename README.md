### Markdown Format

Markdown is much simpler than HTML. It is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Markdown files has a file extension of `.md`.
To learn more about Markdown, check this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab").

### Static Site Generators

Static sites are generally faster than dynamic sites, hence the popularity of static site generators. GitHub pages make use of the [Jekyll](https://jamstack.org/generators/jekyll/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") static site generator. Visit [Jamstock](https://jamstack.org/generators/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") to check the list of popular static site generators.

I have [another site](http://sirgain.droppages.com/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") that was created using [DropPages](https://droppages.com/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab"), a static site generator for Dropbox.

### Multiple pages in GitHub Pages

In order to add additional pages that matches your theme you need to do some tinkering. Check out [this page](https://phuston.github.io/patrickandfrantonarethebestninjas/howto "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") to learn how to create multiple pages in GitHub. Alternatively, you can create additional repositories with individual pages and link all of them.

### Themes

A theme is a predefined design for use in your webpage. Jekyll has the following available themes to choose from:
- [`architect`](https://641n.github.io/architect/)
- [`cayman`](https://641n.github.io/cayman/)
- [`dinky`](https://641n.github.io/dinky/)
- [`hacker`](https://641n.github.io/hacker/)
- [`leap-day`](https://641n.github.io/leap-day/)
- [`merlot`](https://641n.github.io/merlot/)
- [`midnight`](https://641n.github.io/midnight/)
- [`minimal`](https://641n.github.io/minimal/)
- [`modernist`](https://641n.github.io/modernist/)
- [`primer`](https://641n.github.io/primer/)
- [`slate`](https://641n.github.io/slate/)
- [`tactile`](https://641n.github.io/tactile/)
- [`time-machine`](https://641n.github.io/time-machine/)

To change the theme to time-machine, edit the  *_config.yml* file and modify the theme to:
```
theme: jekyll-theme-time-machine
``` 

### Custom Theme

You can create your own custom theme but they involve some work of course. Check out [whoisjuan.github.io](http://whoisjuan.github.io/ "Press Ctrl if you wish to open this link in another tab") for an example. Check this [blog](https://github.blog/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/) to learn more about using other themes in GitHub pages.
